      A long time ago, I kept a paper notebook of recipes I&#39;d loved to make.
      At some point, after a series of downsizing moves, I thought I had lost
      the notebook,
      <strong>but no!</strong>
      My lovely sister found one day while we were cleaning out one of my
      storage lockers.

      I decided to put it online, where it stood a better chance of not getting
      lost again.

      This is about the fourth version of this site. I have been learning React
      for the past couple of years, and was introduced to Gatsby, which is a
      static site generator that uses React to build and manage the static site.
      I figured redoing this site would be a good first try.
