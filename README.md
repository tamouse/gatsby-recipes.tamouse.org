# recipes.tamouse.org site, built in Gatsby

My personal recipes website.

Way back when, I had a paper notebook that I used to write all my
recipes down in. At one point I thought for sure I had lost it, but
**no!** my lovely sister found it while we were pawing through boxes
in my storage lockers.

Nevertheless, I had started this file several years ago on old wiki,
and brought them over here in Jekyll and Bootstrap to update them and
add to them.

Now, I'm learning a new static file generator,
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and this recipe file box seems
like a very appropriate thing to learn with.

## Development

This site was created based upon the starter kit at
<https://github.com/tamouse/gatsby-starter-hello-world>
which is forked from
<https://github.com/NogsMPLS/gatsby-starter-hello-world>
which in turn was forked from the orginal
<https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world>.

### Running the site

    gatsby develop

### Building the site

    gatsby build

### Deploying the site

*T.B.D.*

I haven't yet figured out how or where I will deploy this site. I
currently have most everything hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet, but
using something like `surge.sh` has some appeal as well.

## Plugins, etc

the following packages have been added:
